# Numkell
Numerics routines for Haskell

This library is my attempt to provide a good set of numerics routines for Haskell.
This is actually my first crack at any public Haskell code so early versions of
whats here I fully expect to not be very polished.

If you can help, if you can do it better, please reach out and contribute.
